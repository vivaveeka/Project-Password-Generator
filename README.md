# Module 1 Project | Password Generator

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to build my own game from the following list of options.

1) Strong Random Password Generator
2) Guess The Number
3) Hangman
4) Message Encryption & Decryption
5) Mastermind
6) Tic Tac Toe
7) Blackjack
9) Soldier & Dice (Risk)

I choose to build a random strong password generator. 

## Project Description

In this project, I had to create my first software. I was tasked with creating a game that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources I have learned during the 1st week (out of 10 weeks) of the bootcamp. My game had to take an input from the user and provide an output. I also had to present my game to the class.

## Action

During this project I had to:

- Fork and manage your own git repository.
- Build your own code from scratch.
- Put into practice the basic python concepts learned during the 1st week of the bootcamp.
- Get used to public presentations.


## Result

The result is a strong random password generator with the following rules: 

1) between 8 and 12 characters
2) containing at least one uppercase letter
3) one lowercase letter 
4) one digit and 
5) one special character

Building my own code from scratch led to create a function with a for loop and while loop inside this fuction. In addition I learned how to import and use math and random libraries. Even though we did not learn regular expressions for this project, I think for next time I would have used regular expressions when implementing password generator rules. 

My deliverable was a 5 minute presentation to the class and a link to the repository I used while building your project.
